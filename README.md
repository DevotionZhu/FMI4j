FMI4j is a software suite for dealing with Functional Mock-up Units on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), written in Kotlin. 
It currently consists of two libraries:

## FMI-md

Parses the Model Description file and nothing else.  

## FMI-import

Allows FMUs for Model Exchange and Co-simulation (version 2.0 only) to be imported into applications written for the JVM.
For Model Exchange, solvers are also included.
