FMI4j is a software suite for dealing with Functional Mock-up Units on the Java Virtual Machine (JVM), written in Kotlin. 



Fmi4j allows FMUs for Model Exchange and Co-simulation (version 2.0 only) to be imported into applications written for the JVM.
For Model Exchange, solvers are also included.
